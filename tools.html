            <p class="w3-text-green">I spent a year working as a contracted Jr. Graphics Programmer at San Diego Studio who is best known for their hit series, MLB The Show.
                 I specifcally worked on MLB The Show 23 until its release on March 23, 2023. After that, I continued to fulfill my role for the Studio's next title. As a Jr. 
                 Graphics Programmer I mainly worked in tools, supporting artist and graphics programmers during the development of our games. A big part of my job was to help ease the workload
                on my team members. There was significant techincal debt that had built up over the years during development and I was tasked with helping break down that debt alongside my team. 
                as a result, my tasks stretched over a wide range of contributions in UI, utilities, automation, serliazation/deserialization, and graphics. 
                I performed my duties in a fast paced agile environment maintaining clear and constant communication with my team members. Furthermore I made use of my extensive experience 
                in C++ and Python programming as well as some bash scripting while working with a large AAA engine. One tool I have become very familiar with and has proved incredibly useful throughout 
                both my professional and personal endeavors is ImGui, a graphical user interface. Although I can't go into detail about how I used it during my contract I 
                hope you can take a look at my Real-Time ImGui OpenGL Mesh Viewer. This is a personal project I worked on last year just before getting my job at San Diego Studio.</p>
